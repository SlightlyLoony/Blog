Template Language

  Any text file can be "templatized" simply by including template directives in it.  A template directive may appear anywhere in the template.  Every
  template is surrounded by double braces, like this: {{directive}}.  The directive's opening and closing double braces MUST appear on the same line
  in the source file.  If the source file contains double-braces itself, they must be escaped by using triple braces.  For example, if the source file
  needs to contain the term "abc {{def}} ghi", then it must be escaped as "abc {{{def}}} ghi".

  There are several types of template directives:

  Sources:

    These are named sources of text that may appear anywhere within a template.  The actual text is resolved at the time the template is resolved,
    which is generally while forming the response to a web server request.  A source is specified by a hierarchical name, consisting of components
    separated by periods (dots).  So, for example, the source "user.firstname" would refer to the first name of the user who made the request.
    Similarly, the source "user.last_logged_in.month" would refer first to the user who made the request, then to the time that he last logged in,
    then to the month of that time.  Those dotted names represent the path through the source hierarchy to get to the individual datum desired.  The
    sources available in any given template may vary depending on the template's context.  For instance, the home page template has access to a source
    with a list of posts, while a post page template has access to a source with detailed post information.  All the sources available in the system
    are listed in the "Sources.txt" document.
