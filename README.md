Blog Engine

Implements a relatively simple blog engine with specific features I desired.  There is no intention on my part of making this a generalized blogging
platform, but anyone who wants to use this is more than welcome to do so.

The package includes an embedded Spark web server, which is itself based on an embedded Jetty server.
