Sources

  This document details all sources (and the data available from them) that are available to templates running in various contexts.


  In all contexts:

    root source:

      This source has no name; it is implied as the highest level source in the system.  It has these data available in all contexts:

      user         a user source with various information about a user, or a synthetic record for an anonymous user
      timestamp    a date source that is a timestamp for when the request was received


    date source:

      This source may appear under various names, whenever a date is supplied.  For instance, "user.created" and "timestamp" are both date sources.
      That means that "user.created.hour" will return the hour of the day that the user was created, for example.  A date source has these data
      available:

    user source:

      Available as "user" on the root source.  Note that many of the data available on this source are restricted by what rights the user resolving
      the template has.  Many of the data require, in particular, MANAGER rights.  Any attempt to access data by a user without the appropriate
      rights will result in a "[REDACTED]" string instead of the desired data.  It has these data available:
