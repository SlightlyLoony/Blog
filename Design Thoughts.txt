Architecture:

  There will be three server processes, as follows:
  1.  Monitor server that manages and monitors the other two servers.  This includes running the processes, monitoring their performance, restarting
      them, upgrading/downgrading them, etc.
  2.  HTTPS server that is the main blog server.
  3.  HTTP server that simply redirects to the HTTPS server.


Interprocess messaging:

  The three server processes communicate through a simple network protocol.  The protocol is based on UDP, with packets that contain a single byte
  type code (first byte) followed by a UTF-8 JSON representation of the message (including, redundantly, the type code).  This simple protocol is
  fast and well-suited to the simple types of messages needed (start, stop, ping, keep-alives, etc.).


JSON support:

  Google GSON.


Multiple domain support:

  I will have support for at least three domains right from the beginning: slightlyloony.com, justnorthofparadise.com, and dilatush.com.  This
  implies support for virtual hosting, based on the "Host" HTTP header.  The mapping between "Host" values and content roots should be configurable,
  and should allow for multiple "Host" values to map to a single content root.  In addition, the security for each virtual host needs to be separate
  (so, for example, separate lists of authors for each content root).


Caching:

  Caching should be done through simple string key/string contents LRU caching, with individual caches (for size control) for the various types of
  string content.  Caching of binary content (especially images) needs to be thought out more carefully, but is probably best handled the same way.


Request signatures:

  [www.]<domain>    - request for blog home page
  static.<domain>/? - request for static data, including pages, images, scripts, etc.


Dependencies:

  Web server: Spark/Jetty (embedded)
  Login: simple login, home-brew
  Logging: log4j 2
  email: javamail (javax.mail)


HTTP vs HTTPS:

  The main server will be entirely on HTTPS.  I will also have an (extremely) simple HTTP server that does nothing but redirect to HTTPS.


Hotlink prevention:

  The usual scheme for this is to use HTTP_REFERER, but that's essentially broken by firewalls and many browsers, which simply delete that header.
  An alternative scheme I cooked up, which I found a few references to on the web (so I'm not the first!), is to require that the request for a
  content object be made in the context of a session.  Essentially that means a session cookie.  It appears that Spark/Jetty already supports an
  ephemeral session cookie, which is perfect for the purpose.
