Multiple domain support:

  I will have support for at least three domains right from the beginning: slightlyloony.com, justnorthofparadise.com, and dilatush.com.  This
  implies support for virtual hosting, based on the "Host" HTTP header.  The mapping between "Host" values and content roots should be configurable,
  and should allow for multiple "Host" values to map to a single content root.  In addition, the security for each virtual host needs to be separate
  (so, for example, separate lists of authors for each content root).

Caching:

  Caching should be done through simple string key/string contents LRU caching, with individual caches (for size control) for the various types of
  string content.  Caching of binary content (especially images) needs to be thought out more carefully, but is probably best handled the same way.


Request signatures:

  [www.]<domain>    - request for blog home page
  static.<domain>/? - request for static data, including pages, images, scripts, etc.


Dependencies:

  Web server: Spark/Jetty (embedded)
  Login: simple login, home-brew
  Logging: log4j 2
  email: javamail (javax.mail)


HTTP vs HTTPS:

  The main server will be entirely on HTTPS.  I will also have an (extremely) simple HTTP server that does nothing but redirect to HTTPS.
