Caching:

  Caching should be done through simple string key/string contents LRU caching, with individual caches (for size control) for the various types of
  string content.  Caching of binary content (especially images) needs to be thought out more carefully, but is probably best handled the same way.


Request signatures:

  [www.]<domain>    - request for blog home page
  static.<domain>/? - request for static data, including pages, images, scripts, etc.


Dependencies:

  Web server: Spark/Jetty (embedded)
  Login: simple login, home-brew


HTTP vs HTTPS:

  The main server will be entirely on HTTPS.  I will also have an (extremely) simple HTTP server that does nothing but redirect to HTTPS.
